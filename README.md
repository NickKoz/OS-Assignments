# OS-Assignments
Project in Operation Systems class for my faculty.


## Assignments Structure

There were 4 assignments in total. Each one is located in different directory. In order to run an assignment, you have to run its Makefile that is located in the main directory of each Assignment.

When you are at one's assignment directory, you should type:

```
make run
```
In order to compile the program and then run it.

For more details about the assigments, you should check the code and the comments too.
